Frontend - UI/UX
Backend - Business logic/Data

Frontend - HTML (Structure of text/images), CSS (styling)
Javascript - decion making , dynamicity and logic of website

Deploying and hosting - files are transferred to a public machine, having its own IP address
We can call ip address and get our HTML CSS JS Files 
This public machine is called - Frontend server 

DNS server - special server having the mapping
like 1.12.32 - > xyz.com 

Browser parses the file and shows to user

Why Backend?? 

Database - having private data (personalized) 
Backend server - interacts with database and fetches the data

-------------

Node js - Runtime environment for Javascript to run
Browser - V8 engine (node js is inside v8 engine) for frontend 
Express Js - this lets nodejs works in backend , it creates API 

API - function which is exposed to the internet
2 modules - one needs to expose and another to take - first is API
backend needs to expose and frontend calls the API

Rest(Representational State Transfer) API - do not have their own state but does state Transfer


rm -r * - this command deletes all file in folder

---------------------
STARTING NODE JS:-
1) npm init 
2) create index.js which is entry file
3) npm install express

----------------------
when frontend hits backend it makes request (req)
when backend to frontend what we get is response (res)

Json - javascript object notation (communication happend through objects)

// frontend puts data in Body (req)
// to extract the data from frontend we need to have a key .str is a key(inside which value is there) (it need to be fixed)
// then backend extracts from that key 

// similarly in backend (res)
// frontend needs to know the key from bakend- here "vowel"
